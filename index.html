      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>
        I am a Kellogg MBA Candidate 2017, passionate about education, technology, cooking and outdoor sports. I’ve studied in 5 different schools, have 3 degrees and I am pursuing an MBA. I believe my academic background, my experience working in the financial sector and the community work I have done in the past give me a unique set of tools that will be valuable in my new ventures. I am particularly interested in how we can use and scale technology to improve people’s life across the world. I want to put in practice my knowledge to enable people to achieve greater things though better access to education with the help of technology.
